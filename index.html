  <p><h2>Overview</h2></p>
  <p>I'm a Developer in the making under the tutorship of <strong><a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a></strong>, an intense but exciting tech bootcamp in Nairobi, Kenya.
I have intense passion for AI learning, web and app development, graphic design, animations and creating intriguing and dynamic user experiences.
Let'sjust say something awesome is cooking in six months.</p>
  <p><h2>Projects Done</h2></p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <l1><p><a href="file:///home/kasiera/Documents/moringa-school-projects/hello-world/hello-world.html">Hello World</a>-This was an introduction to block elements and HTML where we learnt about tags, indentation and committing codes in terminal. At this point, Buzz Aldrin was ringing in my head, <i>"One step for man, one step for mankind!"</i></p></l1>
      <l2><p><a href="file:///home/kasiera/Documents/moringa-school-projects/Giraffes/index.html">Giraffes</a>-On this, we were focusing on paragraphs, headers, emphasis and picking colors for statements within the texts written.</l2></p>
      <l3><p><a href="file:///home/kasiera/Desktop/my-first-website/my-first-webpage.html"> My First Webpage</a>- Here we focused on linking pages as well as adding pictures from our folders to the document being created.</l3></p>
      <l4><p><a href="file:///home/kasiera/Desktop/my-first-website/index.html"> My Favorite Things</a>-Here we delved deeper and learnt on how to style our work, add links to your page and rename them, add photos and caption them as well as listing items in an orderly manner.</l4></p>
    </ul>

  <p><h2>About Me</h2></p>
  <p>I am a graduate from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology with a major in Genomic Science which focuses on forensic science, gene sequencing, replication and coding.</p>
  <p>Becoming a developer has been on my bucket list and there hasn't been a better time to pursue that dream than now since there's a global shift towards tech and innovation.</p>
  <p>My hobbies include building things (physical and virtual), watching documentaries, making new friends, and creating memories.</p>
